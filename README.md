imma make this simple for anyone bothering to read this:


i am good with **c++**, **rust**, **java** and **python**. i plan on learning **c** (soon) and actually make use of it.
i use arch btw. 



i enjoy listening to all genres of music, i don't specificaly have one that I dislike



i don't have a project in mind that I am making right now, just following tutorials and stuck in tutorial hell (not really). 



i wanna make my own custom macro pad with customisability made with a microcontroller and custom pcb. 



email me @ 4tkbytes@pm.me if you wanna talk
